### ONA Tabletop.js/Handlebars.js workshop files

[bit.ly/tabletop-repo](http://bit.ly/tabletop-repo)

Maybe you've used pre-packaged vendor tools to create digital news presentations, but you aren't quite ready to tackle full-stack programming, database management and server setup.

Maybe you're hoping reporters will learn how keeping structured data about their beat can benefit the organization.

Or maybe you're looking for a tool that help organize/display information when that breaking news event happens.

Enter [tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) and [handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/), two little JavaScript libraries that play well with one another and play well with one another.

**Session Goal**: Learn how you can use tabletop.js & handlebars.js together to open up really cool custom-mini-CMS possibilities and create manage data-driven projects and interactives.

**What we'll do**:

* Get an idea of [who you are and what you'd like to learn](http://bit.ly/onatabletop).
* Show some example projects ([KPCC](http://www.projects.chrislkeller.com/demos/ona-workshop/3-getting-awesome-with-the-styles/), [WNYC](http://project.wnyc.org/ona-handlebars-demo/), [WaPo](http://wpona.com/)) that we developed for ONA, and offer links to projects [from other news organizations](https://github.com/chrislkeller/ona-workshop/wiki/Project-Examples).
* Provide an [overview](https://github.com/chrislkeller/ona-workshop/wiki/Getting-Started) of the concepts behind tabletop.js and handlebars.js can work together from a setup, JavaScript and design/CSS perspsective.
* Dive into [example code and demos](https://github.com/chrislkeller/ona-workshop/wiki/Links-to-Demos) in groups -- "[Beginner Project](https://github.com/chrislkeller/ona-workshop/tree/master/1-beginner-project)," "[Ready to Play](https://github.com/chrislkeller/ona-workshop/tree/master/2-creating-separate-template-files)," and "[Getting Awesome With the Styles](https://github.com/chrislkeller/ona-workshop/tree/master/3-getting-awesome-with-the-styles)".
* Leave participants with [tutorials and reference materials](https://github.com/chrislkeller/ona-workshop/wiki/Tutorials-and-Reference)
