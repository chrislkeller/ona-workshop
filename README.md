### ONA Tabletop.js/Handlebars.js workshop files

Maybe you've used pre-packaged vendor tools to create digital news presentations, but you aren't quite ready to tackle full-stack programming, database management and server setup.

Or maybe you're looking for a tool that help organize/display information when that breaking news event happens.

Enter [tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) and [handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/), two little JavaScript libraries that play well with one another and play well with one another.
